To use the sprites in this directory as your player's sprites, you need to go into
the Settings menu and enable the option that says "Use custom sprites."

You can get custom sprites off of http://www.spriters-resource.com/ however
they will need to be formatted correctly as Pokemon Unity uses a different
configuration for spritesheets.

Each player sprite will be 32x32 each, excluding the back sprite, which is 80x80.

Thanks for using Pokemon Unity!

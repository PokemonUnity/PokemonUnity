"Pokémon Unity was in development for about a year before I could not continue working on the project. Rather than let it 
die, I released the source as is." - Lucas.

I have changed a lot of code that was either unused (most unused assets were removed) or were obsolete. There can be a lot of conflicts if you're looking forward to using this branch as a framework rather than the [test-project branch](https://github.com/herbertmilhomme/PokemonUnity/tree/TestProject). Please be aware that some features in this branch are incomplete (the features in the [test-project branch](https://github.com/herbertmilhomme/PokemonUnity/tree/TestProject) is being tracked and monitored by the build status).

I strongly recommend that you use the master branch as a base rather than the [test-project branch](https://github.com/herbertmilhomme/PokemonUnity/tree/TestProject). This branch is entirely experimental and the process of being completely redone all over -- possibility of breaking your fangame or other project.

I'm basing the code mimic and emulate the [Pokemon Essentials](http://pokemonessentials.wikia.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Essentials_Wiki) package for RPG Maker MV, which is written in Ruby. But since Ruby follows similar object-oriented coding structures, it's easy to mirror the code to function the same.

Pokémon Unity was in development for about a year before I could not continue working on the project. Rather than let it
die, I released the source as is.

Naturally this leaves it in a fairly incomplete state, albeit functional.

There's a lot of legacy code left over from when I was learning to use Unity, so some scripts (namely the PC and Bag interfaces) are 
functional though implemented rather poorly.

I'm hoping that the Pokémon Game Development Community will be able to continue my work and eventually get this project into a fully 
functional state.

If you need to contact me regarding the project for any reason, you can reach me via my YouTube channel, or the subreddit 
/r/PokemonUnity although I can't guarantee when I'll see it or how much I can help. I will try though.

Thank you to everyone who supported me during the development of Pokémon Unity. I hope this source is useful.

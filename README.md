As Pokemon Unity is still in it's incomplete form and couldn't have new features added, I've decided to take it upon myself and expand upon the framework. Major changes I've had planned include player customization, Pokedex interaction, and various options for programmers to toggle easily. My reasoning for starting this project is to make it more versatile and easier for fangame projects and the like.

I have changed a lot of code that was either unused (most unused assets were removed) or were obsolete. There can be a lot of conflicts if you're looking forward to using this branch as a framework rather than the master branch. Please be aware that some features in this branch are incomplete.

I strongly recommend that you use the master branch as a base rather than the develop branch. This branch is entirely experimental and has the possibility of breaking your fangame or other project.

## Demo and Downloads

There will not be any demos released for PKUE until the branches merge.

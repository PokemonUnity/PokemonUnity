# Tiled2PkUnity
Tiled2PkUnity is a tool designed to replace the RPG maker process for collision maps.

# Thanks for using my tool!
Tiled2PkUnity was developed by TeamPopplio.

**For support with the app, please contact [TeamPopplio](https://github.com/TeamPopplio) rather than the original PkUnity developers/maintainers. This application is seperate from the framework itself.**
